		<h1>Terms of Service for Feader.us</h1>
		
		<p>Updated: August 5, 2013</p>
		
		<p>By using this Feader.us RSS feed service, you are agreeing to these terms. Please read them carefully.</p>
		
		<p>The Feader.us service, in its current incarnation, is free to use. I will likely limit the number of people who can use it because, frankly, running a web app costs money and I am only willing to spend so much. If I do decide to start charging then I'll let you know (on the site.. somehow... before you receive a bill), and I'll try to provide convenient ways to pay that bill. But that isn't very likely.</p>
		
		<p>The Feader.us service could go away at any time, though I will try to give you ample notice and provide you ways to export any information (feed URLS) that you have collected in the service.</p>
		
		<p>The Feader.us could, at any time, break or become unreachable. The service lives on someone else's servers and I am merely a human software developer, myself. So things won't always be perfect. If you see problems or something appears broken, then feel free to contact me at info at tefworks dot com. I will try to fix things, but I can't guarantee a fix nor can I guarantee that I will respond to you (but I probably will). The moral of this story is that you use this web app at your own risk and I don't guarantee anything.</p>

		<p>By using the Feader.us service, you agree not to abuse it. This means don't set up bots to continually hit the service. Also please don't hack into it and mess with stuff. That doesn't help anyone. There are many more worthwhile causes for you to direct your destructive intentions towards.</p>
		
		<p>In the end, if you don't like the terms or the privacy policies of this service, then it is probably best you don't use it.</p>
		
		<p>My name is Troy and I originally wrote this for my own use. So most of the limitations and bahaviors of the software are by design. This is how I read feeds. I hope you like it.</p>
