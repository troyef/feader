		<h1>Privacy policy for Feader.us</h1>
		
		<p>Updated: August 5, 2013</p>
		
		<p>This is the privacy policy for the Feader.us RSS feed reader service. This site is meant to provide a convenient way to read RSS entries of your choosing. We want you to be clear about what information we collect and how we use it.</p>
		
		<h2>Information we collect and how we use it.</h2>

		<p>We collect vague identification information about all of our users. Specifically, we keep a record of your Google+ account identifier. We need an identifier to know to show you your feeds, and since we have selected a Google+ authentication service, we store the id number that they provide. That number tends to look something like this: 1006829862364787816. (We apologize if that is your number, we made that one up.) We could store some other information such as name or any other info that Google+ provides to us, but we choose not to. (This also means that we don't have a way to contact you in case there are system problems or we decide to shut things down - see our terms of service.)<br/>
			In other words, we don't really know anything about you and we won't do anything with what we do know except recognize that you are wanting to see your feeds, and then we'll attempt to show them to you.</p>
		
		<h2>Other Stuff</h2>
		
		<p>This is a feed service. So when you enter a feed you want to read, we will store that feed and some information such as the last entry you read from that feed. This information will be associated in our database with your user token. This is necessary. Also, Google+ probably puts a cookie on your machine to know you are you.  That's not on us. We do use Google analytics to track the number of people coming to the site, but that typically can't identify specific people, so you probably don't need to worry about that.</p>
		
		
		<p>This is a feed service. And it is free. By using this service you agree to this privacy policy. You also agree not to hold Tefworks or anyone affiliated with this service responsible for anything related to this site, ever.</p>
		
		<p>In the end, if you don't like the terms or the privacy policies of this service, then it is probably best you don't use it. If you decide not to keep using it and decide you want us to delete your info from the server, then contact us at info at tefworks dot com and we will see what we can do.</p>
